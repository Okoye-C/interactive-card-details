  ### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process  
Not knowing much about javascript, I focused more on HTML and SCSS to perfect the layout and finished design before tackling the javascript aspect of this challenge. I had problems figuring out whether to add the image as a background image in css or adding it to my HTML. For the CSS, I had problems with using position absolute. I'm still trying to figure out how to not use it in cases like this. Hopefully as I engage in more challenges, I'll figure it out. 

As for the Javascript, I had problems everywhere, but fortunately, I had help from a particular youtube video. I unfortunately cannot remember the persons channel or name, but it was of huge help. I was able to understand what to do and why I would need to do it. JavaScript took most of my time, then the CSS. HTML was relatively easier to figure out.
